Discuss whether these nearest neighbors make sense. Are they semantically similar or related in any obvious way?\n\n- The embeddings do a reasonable job of capturing broad topical similarities but struggle with fine-grained semantic distinctions.\n- Queries about widely discussed topics (e.g., education, Quora ranking) return better matches than niche topics (e.g., business ideas, astrologers).\n- Some irrelevant matches likely arise due to token-based similarity rather than true semantic understanding.\n- \n### Let's see the queries\n\n#### Query 1: Social Media Experts\n\n- The retrieved questions are somewhat relevant, as they discuss social media marketing, tools, and agencies.\n- However, some results are loosely connected, such as discussions about social media campaigns rather than experts specifically.\n- The model does capture some level of topical similarity, but it's not perfectly refined.\n#### Query 2: Technology & Education\n\n- The top three retrieved questions are highly relevant, as they directly address how technology impacts education.\n- The last two results diverge slightly into social development and computer education, which are related but not exact matches.\n- Overall, this set of nearest neighbors demonstrates strong semantic similarity.\n#### Query 3: Quora Ranking System\n\n- Some retrieved questions are related to Quora, answer ranking, and responses, which align well with the query.\n- Others (e.g., job interview questions) deviate significantly, suggesting the model is picking up on general themes of ranking or responses rather than the specific context of Quora.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Question 2: Neural Networks","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1 Data Preparation & Splitting","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
